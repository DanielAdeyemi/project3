### *by Daniel Adeyemi (12/19/2020)*
## Description:
This project aimed to conclude my introductory course at **Epicodus** with focus on loops, arrays, regular expressions and basics of testing by using pseudocode.
## Setup
* clone repository to your text editor using following [URL](https://github.com/DanielAdeyemi/project3)
* if you want to see my code - go to the specific part of my project, such as *index.html* for main code or to *css/styles.css* to check stylesheet or *scripts.js* to review my java script functions.
* after that you can run index.html page through your terminal, using command: *open index.html* to view my page. **Please make sure you are inside right folder before run the command**
* Also if you just want to check my project website, you can open it through [GitHub pages](https://danieladeyemi.github.io/Portfolio/)
## Tecnologies used

## Testing
#### Describe: *array()*
#### Test: *"Should return array of numbers from 0 to user input"*
#### Expected outcome: *array(5).toEqual([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])*
#### Describe: *check()*
#### Test: *Checking for valid input and return alert if input less than 1 or not a number""*
#### Expected outcome: *check(la).toEqual("Enter valid number, please.")*
#### Describe: *three()*
#### Test: "If any number in array contains digit "3" - replace it with "Won't you be my neighbor?" with highest priority"
#### Expected outcome: *three(32).toEqual("Won't you be my neighbor?")*
#### Describe:*two()*
#### Test: "If any number contains digit "2" - replace it with "Boop!" with second priority (3 will take precedent over 2)"
#### Expected outcome:*two(21).toEqual("Boop!")*
#### Describe: *one()*
#### Test: *"If any number contains digit "1" -replace it with "Beep!" with lowest priority (after 2 and 3)"*
#### Expected outcome:*one(10).toEqual("Beep!")*
